# Carbone Entertainment Event Management Application

## A case study describing the implementation of a custom Salesforce application

[Carbone Entertainment](https://carboneentertainment.com/) is a talent agency that specializes in pairing you with the perfect artist, performer, and activity for your event. Let's say you are hosting your child's birthday party and would like to hire the most amazing [Face Painter](https://carboneentertainment.com/service/face-painters/), Carbone connects you with that artist and handles the contracting, logistical coordination, and billing. Things get more complicated when the scale of the event increases to include many performers, a complicated venue, or an entire performance series across multiple days & months!

In order to streamline the business operation, I created a custom Salesforce application to manage the sales and fulfillment processes from end-to-end. The platform centralizes the talent database, contract management system, and customer engagement platform.

This case study will describe how I implemented the custom Salesforce application to improve our business by outlining the:

- Data Structure;
- Contracting Solution; and
- Problems Solved by the Application.
